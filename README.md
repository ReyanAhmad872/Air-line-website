# Air-line-website
This is a simple airline website project created using pure HTML.  It contains: - A navigation bar - A home section with a welcome message and logo - An about section with images and an embedded video - A services section showing different destinations - A contact form for user interaction  This project is part of my learning journey in HTML.
